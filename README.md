# Developing a Cross Platform Game 2.0

**https://srg774.github.io/Phantom-Leap/**

Most of the assets were sourced from opengameart.org, all under the CC0 license to avoid any attribution issues. I found the pumpkin sprite, music, sound effects, and ghost there. The coffin was generated using Craiyon ai, while I created the starry background, text, and restart button myself. I opted for a pixel art style, given its nostalgic feel and suitability for the game's aesthetic. Although I sought crisp-looking sprites, they were somewhat hard to find. I did, however, come across a large collection of 8-bit style music and art, which fit the theme well.

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the game!
