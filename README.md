# Developing a Cross Platform Game 2.0 ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»

**https://srg774.github.io/Phantom-Leap/**

Encouraged by the positive feedback from friends and family regarding the first iteration of the platform game I created, I decided to take it to the next level. Now, Iâ€™m approaching what may be the conclusion of my current game development project!

## Overview

I envisioned a Halloween theme with improved art, animation, effects, and music. Since the game mechanics and gameplay were reasonably well-developed, the main task was to determine which assets I needed and where to place them. Initially, I thought I could simply overlay things, but it required more iterations and tweaks than anticipated. However, I utilized a lot of what I learned to streamline the process.

## Asset Sourcing

I sourced many assets from [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org), all under the CC0 license, to avoid issues with attribution. There, I found:
- The pumpkin sprite
- Music
- Sound effects
- The ghost

The coffin was generated using Crayon AI, while the star background, text, and restart button were drawn directly. I chose a pixel art style for its familiarity and game-friendly appearance. Although I looked for crisp-looking sprites, they are not widely available. Additionally, I found a vast library of 8-bit style music and art, which is also nostalgic for me.

## Development Process

This stage took another 7 hours of iterations and tweaks with ChatGPT. I developed everything offline this time on my Chromebook, using a text editor and running the `index.html` file to test the game before uploading it to GitHub directly. The process included a lot of page refreshes and, unlike my previous project which had 192 deplys and 7 hours of work, this time it was a single deployment that worked almost right away. The music needed a couple of page refreshes to load properly.

## Sound and Music

I mostly play games without sound, but as I was upgrading this time, I wanted to see what was possible. I hope you enjoy the game, and happy Halloween!
