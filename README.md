# Ghost Jump

**Ghost Jump** is a spooky-themed vertical platformer game created using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Players control a ghostly character that jumps across falling bones while collecting souls and avoiding a haunting demise.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Use the arrow keys (or touch controls on mobile) to move left or right and jump.
- Land on bone platforms to bounce higher.
- Catch falling ghosts to earn "souls" and increase your score.
- The game speeds up gradually, and music tempo adjusts dynamically to reflect the increasing intensity.
- If you fall or miss platforms, it's game over!

## 🕹 Controls

| Action        | Input             |
|---------------|------------------|
| Move Left     | `← Arrow` or left screen touch |
| Move Right    | `→ Arrow` or right screen touch |
| Jump          | `↑ Arrow` or `Spacebar` or tap screen |

## 📁 Assets

The game loads various assets from the `/assets/` directory:
- `spriteR.png`, `spriteL.png`, `spriteJump.png` – Player sprite variations
- `spritebone.png`, `spriteselectbone.png` – Bone platform graphics
- `spriteghost.png` – Ghost image
- Audio:
  - `theme.mp3` – Background music
  - `intro.mp3` – Intro music
  - `jump.ogg`, `ghost.ogg`, `die.ogg`, `ready.ogg`, `go.ogg`, `end.mp3` – Sound effects

Ensure these files are present in an `assets` directory relative to your HTML file.

## 🚀 Running the Game

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports modern JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.
3. Click or press a key to unlock and start audio due to browser autoplay policies.
4. Jump, dodge, and survive!

## 🧱 Features

- Dynamic music playback speed tied to game speed.
- Ghost object animation for bonus points.
- Starfield background with animated flickering stars.
- Progressive difficulty with increasing platform speed.
- "Ready" and "Go" splash screens with corresponding sound effects.
- Themed end screen with different messages based on your performance.

## 🔊 Audio Handling

Due to browser restrictions on autoplaying audio, the game waits for a user interaction (click or keypress) to start playing the intro and theme music. Theme music resets and plays fresh each time the game starts.

## 🧪 Known Issues

- Mobile controls are basic and may not behave consistently across all devices.
- Asset paths must be correctly set relative to your HTML file.
- Some audio formats (e.g., `.ogg`) may not play on all browsers; consider adding fallback formats.

## 📦 To Do (Ideas)

- Add sound toggle options.
- Implement high score tracking.
- Add new types of platforms or hazards.
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness.
