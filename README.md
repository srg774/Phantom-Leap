# Developing a Cross Platform Game 2.0 ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»

Encouraged by the positive feedback from friends and family on the first iteration of my platform game, I decided to take the project to the next level. 
Initially, I wanted the theme to be personal, perhaps related to the type of work I do. However, with Halloween approaching and so many great assets available for that theme, I decided to shift in that direction. 

At first, I envisioned a pumpkin-head sprite jumping on bones (hence the name "SpriteBone"), but that didnâ€™t quite look right. So, I switched to coffins instead. To add a bit of flair, I included a ghost or soul rising from the coffin as the sprite jumps up and down. I was mindful not to make it too similar to classic 8-bit games, and I think I managed to avoid that. 

I envisioned a Halloween-themed game with enhanced art, animation, effects, and music. Since the core mechanics and game play were fairly developed, my main task was identifying which assets I needed and where to place them. Initially, I thought it would be a simple matter of overlaying assets, but it took more iterations and tweaks than I anticipated. However, I leveraged what I had learned to streamline the process.

Most of the assets were sourced from opengameart.org, all under the CC0 license to avoid any attribution issues. I found the pumpkin sprite, music, sound effects, and ghost there. The coffin was generated using Craiyon ai, while I created the starry background, text, and restart button myself. I opted for a pixel art style, given its nostalgic feel and suitability for the game's aesthetic. Although I sought crisp-looking sprites, they were somewhat hard to find. I did, however, come across a large collection of 8-bit style music and art, which fit the theme well.

Iâ€™ll provide a screenshot of the assets as a snapshot of this stage. It took a whole weekend of iterations and tweaks with ChatGPT to refine everything. This time, I developed the game offline on my Chromebook, using a text editor and testing it by running the index.html file locally before uploading to GitHub. This time, I achieved a single deployment that worked almost immediately. Only the music needed a few extra page refreshes to load properly.
After finishing the game's design over the weekend, I spent two evenings packaging it as efficiently as I could. I explored Progressive Web Apps (PWA), a lightweight Google innovation that allows the game to work offline and function like a native app. While itâ€™s been hit-or-miss on some devices, it works smoothly on my Android phone.

I also tackled a steep learning curve with preview images, particularly for platforms like WhatsApp. I found that using images of a certain resolution or higher solved the issue. Now, Iâ€™m nearly ready for deployment.

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the game!
